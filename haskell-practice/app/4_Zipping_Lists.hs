-- Zipping is a way of combining two lists into a list of pairs (tuples). 
-- The zip function takes two lists as inputs and combines corresponding elements from each list into pairs. 
-- The result is a list of tuples, with each tuple containing one element 
-- from each of the input lists at the same position.

-- The length of the resulting list is determined by the shorter of the two input lists. 
-- If one list is longer than the other, the extra elements are ignored, 
-- which ensures that every tuple has an element from each list.

-- Syntax of zip
-- zip :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a, b)]

-- zip takes two lists: [a] and [b].
-- It returns a list of pairs [(a, b)], where each pair contains one element from each input list.

-- Examples of zip
-- zip [1, 2, 3] ["One", "Two", "Three"] results in [(1, "One"), (2, "Two"), (3, "Three")].
-- zip [1, 2] [True, False, True] results in [(1, True), (2, False)]â€”note that the last True in the second list is ignored.

-- Other Related Functions
-- zipWith: Allows you to combine two lists with a custom function rather than just forming tuples. 
-- For example, zipWith (+) [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6] gives [5, 7, 9].

-- unzip: Splits a list of tuples into two separate lists. 
-- For example, unzip [(1, "One"), (2, "Two")] returns ([1, 2], ["One", "Two"]).

-- Zips lists where one list is shorter, ignoring extra elements in the longer list.
